# pomodoro-timer
A simple Pomodoro Timer built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to improve focus using the Pomodoro Technique. It starts with a 25-minute countdown and provides three controls: Start to begin/resume, Stop to pause, and Reset to restart the timer. When the countdown reaches zero, an alert notifies the user that the session has ended.
